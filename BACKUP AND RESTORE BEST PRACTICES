 BACKUP AND RESTORE BEST PRACTICES
Backup Best Practices:
Schedule Regular Backups: Use cron jobs or task scheduler to perform daily/weekly backups.

Store Backups in Multiple Locations: Save backups both locally and in cloud storage for redundancy.

Backup Verification: Regularly test backup files by performing a restore on a test database.

Restore Best Practices:
Test Restores: Periodically restore your database to ensure backups are working properly.

Monitor for Corruption: After restoring, verify that the data is intact by checking table counts and consistency.

Backup Before Making Changes: Always take a backup before making major changes to the database schema or data.
